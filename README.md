JavaScript Hacks

#### Purpose
- To better learn and understand JS, including ES6 and newer

##### What to focus on
- While I understand functions when I read them, I would like to spend a bit of time writing some advanced functions
- I would like a better understanding of the DOM, so I will also work on learning more about that.

#### Why am I doing this.
- I have always been curious about coding and developing, but I have never really gone to school to learn it.
- My current job at work affords me a lot of opportunities to work with developers and I have done a lot of learning so far.
- I have had some great help from developers at work, and also taken some online classes from Udacity and StackSkills.
- I would ultimately enjoy being a developer, so I should really do what I can to hone my skills.
- I would also like to get to know Git better and how to use it to cut branches and push to master from there.
