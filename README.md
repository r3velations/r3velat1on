# r3velat1on JS
JavaScript Hacks

#### Purpose
- To better learn and understand JS, including ES6 and newer

##### What to focus on
- While I understand functions when I read them, I would like to spend a bit of time writing some advanced functions
- I would like a better understanding of the DOM, so I will also work on learning more about that.

#### Why am I doing this.
- I have always been curious about coding and developing, but I haven't obtained formal education in the field.
- I have, however, taken numerous courses through Udacity, Udemy, and StackSkills.This has provided me with a strong foundation.
- I am currently on a small agile team at work which also provides me with many tremendous opportunities to learn.
  - I am a scrum master on the team, but also work as a Testing Analyst and can even do some of the basic coding.
- I have had help from a few awesome developers at work and taken an internal JS class taught by one of the developers.
  - Matt Jarrett - awesome guy and the one who got me started on this journey.
  - Priyanka (Pinky) Ravi - A young and ambitious developer who will probably code the downfall of society and kick off the machine war through her studies on machine learning.
  - Charles Stokes - Most interesting man in the world. Talk to him for 20 minutes and you'll see what I'm talking about.
  - James Qu - This guy has a great understanding of things and can explain them very thoroughly.
- Whether or not I ultimately become a developer is yet to be seen, but I think this is important stuff to know in a technology driven world.
